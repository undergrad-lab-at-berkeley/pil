# PIL website

This repository uses the **Jekyll** Minima Theme + some custom scripts.

Edit whatever `*.md` file. Then view with (assuming you've already installed ruby)

```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Pushes to the `main` branch automatically update to the website, so be careful. (But also, I don't care if it crashes just fix it lol)
