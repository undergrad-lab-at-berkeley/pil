We are a student run organization.

The Berkeley Paul L. Richards Physics Innovation Lab (PIL) employs a student-led staffing model designed to foster an inclusive environment that encourages peer-to-peer mentorship and leadership. Unlike larger maker spaces, which often present significant barriers to entry through stringent training requirements, cost to enter, or restrictions tied to specific coursework, PIL is intentionally structured to lower these barriers. It provides a welcoming, approachable environment that invites students of diverse backgrounds, particularly those who might otherwise hesitate to engage with makerspaces.
